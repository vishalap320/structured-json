# Stream-of-Consciousness Journal Structuring

This task involves converting a freeform, stream-of-consciousness journal entry from a software developer into a **structured JSON format**. The goal is to organize thoughts under six predefined categories:

- **Health & Well-being**
- **Family & Relationships**
- **Work Stress**
- **Community & Meaningful Work**
- **Emotional State**
- **Habits & Patterns**

The output structure includes **entry numbers**, **titles**, and **categorized thoughts**.
