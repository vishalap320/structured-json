# Stream-of-Consciousness Journal Structuring

This task involves converting a freeform, stream-of-consciousness journal entry from a software developer into a **structured JSON format**. The goal is to organize thoughts under six predefined categories:

- **Health & Well-being**
- **Family & Relationships**
- **Work Stress**
- **Community & Meaningful Work**
- **Emotional State**
- **Habits & Patterns**

The output structure includes **entry numbers**, **titles**, and **categorized thoughts**.

##  Libraries Used

Only one standard library is used:

- It allows you to convert Python data (like lists and dictionaries) into a JSON string and vice versa.

>  No additional  libraries are used in this code.

## What Can This Code Do?

This code defines a structured JSON format that organizes a person's thoughts  into categories such as **health**, **family**, **work**, **emotions**, and more.

Then, it prints that data as a formatted  JSON string.


# Demo Code

```python
import json

# Structured data from a stream-of-consciousness journal
structured_data = [
    {
        "entry_number": 1,
        "title": "Balancing Work and Health",
        "categories": {
            "Health & Well-being": [
                "Feeling fatigued due to long screen time.",
                "Skipped lunch again — need to fix this habit."
            ],
            "Family & Relationships": [
                "Missed my sister's call — need to catch up."
            ],
            "Work Stress": [
                "Deadlines piling up.",
                "Code reviews are mentally draining."
            ],
            "Community & Meaningful Work": [
                "Haven't contributed to the open-source project in weeks."
            ],
            "Emotional State": [
                "Feeling overwhelmed but hopeful."
            ],
            "Habits & Patterns": [
                "Late-night coding sessions are becoming routine."
            ]
        }
    }
]

# Pretty-print the JSON structure
print(json.dumps(structured_data, indent=4))

## Use Cases

- Organizing stream-of-consciousness text into structured data
- Saving personal logs in a readable and machine-processable format
- Feeding structured data to front-end apps, dashboards, or AI tools

## Summary

This script builds and prints a clean, categorized JSON structure from journal-like thoughts using only the built-in `json` library.
